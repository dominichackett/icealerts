## Summary

ICE Alerts is a groundbreaking decentralized application (dApp) that leverages Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to offer a lifeline in emergency medical situations. This innovative dApp combines the power of blockchain with the convenience of NFC to create an In Case of Emergency (ICE) Medical Alert Card or Bracelet system. It's designed to ensure that critical medical information and emergency contacts are readily accessible when they matter most, even when an individual cannot communicate their health status.
